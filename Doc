-- Need to fix the size of the data canopy such that the last chunk is assigned whatever remains of the column and not a fixed size. <FIXED>

-- Rethink typeDef and Rethink C vs. CPP interface.

-- Make the sizes of things unsigned long

-- Confirm that the addition of values is being reflected. <fixed>

-- Define a function that allows to construct the data canopy up to an arbitrary level at an arbitrary 
data region. 

-- The major bottleneck is the insert function as I am using a lock for now. We need a non-locking version. The current implementation does 
not scale well when we insert values.
